# BBC Software Engineering 2019/20 Front-end Test
This is a website built using React and Material-UI that allows users to rank articles on a scale of 1 to 10. It obtains the articles as JSON files using the GitHub API from the [BBC Repository](https://github.com/bbc/news-coding-test-dataset "BBC Repository").

> I would like to be considered for all three area's (Native App trainees, Web App trainees and Backend trainees) however, I have a preference for **Backend** but since there is not test for backend, the email stated to complete either code test so I have completed the Web App test.
